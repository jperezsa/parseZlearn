Freshmeat Conversion 8hz-mp3 http://www.8hz.com/mp3/ 8hz-mp3 is the name for the 8hz Productions MPEG audio encoder, They've been hackin' away at it for a couple of days. The result seems not to be too bad (they think). They have borrowed heavily from the 'official' ISO sources (as has everybody else, it seems ;) ) and came up with this little program. At this moment this encoder only supports MPEG I layer III. (but hey, what else would you want to encode anyway?) This encoder seems to be reasonably fast and it's totally free.

Freshmeat Conversion cocoon http://java.apache.org/ Cocoon is a 100% pure Java publishing framework servlet that relies on new W3C technologies (such as DOM, XML, and XSL) to provide web content. Web content generation is mostly based on HTML, but HTML doesn't separate the information from its presentation, mixing formatting tags, descriptive tags and programmable logic (both on server side and client side). Cocoons changes this view allowing content to be written in XML, style on XSL stylesheets (or, given the latest XSL specification which is not currently implemented, on XSLT transformation sheets) and logic another XSL stylesheet that converts the whole thing to the XSP namespace. This allows the complete separation (placing them on different files) of the three layers used to create content. The Cocoon framework creates web content by processing these layers with the ability to create, for example, valid HTML as output.

Freshmeat Conversion debiangnulinux http://www.debian.org/ Debian is a free, or Open Source, operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer, does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs. Debian uses the Linux kernel, a free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by (probably over 1000) programmers worldwide. A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from GNU, which are also free. Of course, the thing that people want is software; tools to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 1500 packages (precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine).

Freshmeat Conversion ecg2png http://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/ ecg2png converts scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also, typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be compressed efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.

Freshmeat Conversion filaments http://www.cs.uga.edu/~dkl/filaments/dist.html Filaments is a library package that can be used to create architecture-independent parallel programs, i.e. programs that are portable and efficient across vastly different parallel machines. Programs can be written (or generated) with the focus on the parallelism inherent in the application, not the architecture. Also, programs can be written that use familiar shared-variable communication. Furthermore, Filaments uses a carefully designed API along with machine-specific runtime libraries and preprocessing that allow programs to run unchanged on both shared- and distributed-memory machines. Most importantly, applications programmed in Filaments run efficiently, achieving a speedup of over 4 on 8 processors or nodes in almost all tests that have been performed.

Freshmeat Conversion keynote http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~angelos/keynote.html KeyNote provides a simple notation for specifying both local security policies and security credentials that can be sent over an untrusted network. Policies and credentials, called "assertions" as in PolicyMaker, contain predicates that describe the trusted actions permitted by the holders of specific public keys. A signed assertion that can be sent over an untrusted network is called a Credential Assertion. Credential assertions, which serve the role of "certificates," have the same syntax as policy assertions with the additional feature that they are signed by the entity delegating the trust. A KeyNote evaluator accepts as input a set of local policy assertions, a collection of credential assertions, and a collection of attributes, called an "action environment," that describes a proposed trusted action associated with a set of public keys. KeyNote determines whether proposed actions are consistent with local policy by applying the assertion predicates to the action environment.

Freshmeat Conversion l2tpd http://www.marko.net/l2tp/ Layer two tunneling protocol is a method for encapsulating standard PPP through a variety of media.

L2TP consists of two pieces: the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and the L2TP Network Server (LNS). The LAC is the device which physically terminates a call. The LNS is the part which terminates and probably authenticates the PPP stream.

Freshmeat Conversion libasset http://www.sylvantech.com/~talin/projects/libasset.html libasset is a C library for game developers, designed to simplify the process of managing and distributing game assets such as sprites, textures, sounds, MIDI files, etc. Rather than using a proprietary resource file format as is done in many commercial games, it assumes that the assets are stored in an ordinary zip file. The library allows fast, random-access retrieval of assets. It also supports the idea of an "asset path", which consists of either zipfiles or real directories, similar to the Java "classpath" concept. In this way, the artists working on the game need only to place their working directories on the path before the main resource file, which will cause any assets that they produce to override similarly-named assets in the main resource file.

Freshmeat Conversion minotaur http://mini.net/pub/ts2/minotaur.html Minotaur is a generalized extension which lets you run Python scripts from Tcl, or Tcl from Perl, or any of the other combinations. Minotaur works by loading the appropriate shared library into another script language's context. So, for example, running Tcl from Python means that the Python main program imports the Minotaur extension, which in turn loads the Tcl libraries - thus Tcl becomes "embedded" into the Python runtime environment (which is similar to embedding Tcl in a normal C program). As involved as that sounds, performance is already surprisingly good, and the capability is turning out to be quite useful. Minotaur 0.1 is an alpha level release, meaning: it works, aside from a few quirks and bugs, but its API and implementation might still change in incompatible ways in future releases.

Freshmeat Conversion prevail http://scripts.bitchx.com The BitchX version of prevail is now being maintained by RoboHak and fudd. This latest release has been mostly recoded by RoboHak. One really interesting thing that has been added to this version is the use of stub files. These files allow aliases that arent used very often to not even be loaded until the time that they are needed. After they are used they are unloaded. This makes the memory usage a lot lower and creates a huge speed increase. The release of 0123 was mainly to fix a bug found in 0105 where users were able to exploit /encode to make anyone running pv-0105 controllable remotely. A few other things were added such as a feature to set default channel modes and 2 more ansis. I highly suggest that anyone using prevail version 0105 upgrade immediately so as not to be succeptable to the encode exploit. Also, anyone who has not tried prevail, check this out, I think youll be pleasantly surprised by its great features and speed.

Freshmeat Conversion prezip http://www.torque.net/~campbell/ preZIP is a utilty to format a ZIP disk to have a dual identity. One very small MS-DOS partition and a much larger ext2fs partition.The basic idea is that the small MS-DOS partiton contains the bare minimum (loadlin+kernel+batch file) to fire up linux on a foreign machine. Previously ZipSlack was the only distribution known to run from a ZIP disk using a UMSDOS filesystem. While this is good it was impossible to install other distributions (such as RedHat and Debian) to a UMSDOS filesystem. This tool addresses some (not all) issues around creating a ZIP disk for a "foreign" machine. This tool will only work for the parallel port ZIP drive and ZIP Plus drive (on a parallel port).

Freshmeat Conversion shash http://hq.hellug.gr/~mcrypt/shash/ shash is a program which produces message digests for files, and checks whether the digest remains the same (i.e., whether the files changed). Since anyone can generate the message digest, it may not be suitable for some security-related applications. Because of this, shash also supports HMAC (rfc2104), which is a mechanism for message authentication using cryptographic hash functions. shash can use a key with a hash algorithm to produce hashes that can only be verified with the same key. This way, you can securely check whether files in a filesystem were altered.

Freshmeat Conversion triplight http://linux.rice.edu/magic/triplight/ Triplight is an intrusion detection, and integrity monitor system. This release is rather unpolished (you need to hack up a crontab file, and to set a file path in the perl source), but fully functional. To accomplish its design goals, it reads in a list of files stored in flat ASCII, and uses md5sum to check their integrity against that recorded earlier in a database. If the database is placed on a read-only medium such as a write-protected floppy, then it should provide an infallible record against remotely installed trojan horses. Thus by monitoring the integrity of the system, triplight will serve as an aid in intrusion detection.

The main goals for Zebedee are to provide full client and server functionality under both UNIX and Windows 95/98/NT, to be easy to install, use and maintain with little or no configuration required, to have a small footprint, low wire protocol overhead and give significant traffic reduction by the use of compression and to use only algorithms that are either unpatented or for which the patent has expired.

apolis cita1 Oponerse a Micro$oft y a todo lo que representa no es un hobby excntrico,es el ltimo acto de patriotismo de la era digital (Annimo)

apolis cita3 (...) Pero durante esa audicin, Bill Gates ni siquiera quiso aceptar que Micro$oft goza de una situacin de monopolio. Entonces prosegu: "Cunta gente en esta sala no utiliza un programa Micro$oft?". Respuesta: nadie. As demostr que hay monopolio. (Jim Barksdale, presidente de NetScape)
