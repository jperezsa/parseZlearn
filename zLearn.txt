For such sessions, variables can be stored on the server. This will let you write complex Web-based applications. Additionally, websites can be customized by the user since it is also possible to store user variables.

dA small bug in the Linux networking code has been found, and just as quickly patched. The bug affects all Linux 2.2 kernels, and can be fixed by removing "kfree_skb(skb);" from around line 455 of linux/net/ipv4/ip_options.c. Big thanks to Alan Cox on this one.

dhttp://finbar.dyndns.org/programs/acro/ Acro is a Perl program which generates random sequences of characters. It allows you to specify how many characters should be in a sequence and whether the sequence should be in upper- or lower-case letters. It also allows you to give a Perl character class to describe what characters you want in your sequence. Its inspiration comes from the Undernet IRC channel #acro. Its primary use, aside from building a fake acrobot (that's the bot of #acro), is password generation.

Currently, you can morph among sorted list, BST, splay tree, and red-black tree representations; more are going to be added as time goes on. In spite of the flexibility, the C declarations of dictionary and dictionary nodes are visible to you and do not change. You can therefore still embed dictionary nodes into your own objects, which can then be linked together.

A container is a regular file or block device, so it is possible to backup, move, or copy it to other disk (CD-ROM or network, for instance) and continue to access encrypted data using BestCrypt. BestCrypt supports the following encryption algorithms: GOST in Cipher Feedback mode and BLOWFISH, DES, TWOFISH in Cipher Block Chaining mode. A container can be formatted for any filesystem supported by Linux (MINIX, EXT, EXT2, FAT, FAT32, and others) and mounted as an additional volume to any mount point.

Bond agents can be dynamically assembled using a text mode description in the "blueprint" agent specification language. They support form migration, checkpointing, and remote control, and also "agent surgery" which allows for runtime modification of agents.

It can be used in the case that you want to have full control over who can send and receive SMS messages (that you are paying the transmission costs for). The administrator can create user accounts for people that are allowed to send or receive SMS messages. Both Sender and Receiver accounts can be assigned to groups. This way it is possible to hide the Receiver accounts belonging to one group from a user that is not part of this group.

"cg" does the search through code, storing matches in the user's home directory and displaying matches, and "vg" opens an editor at the line in the file where a particular match was found. Some features include color and human-readable output, resizing to screen width, support for many editors, recursive searching, a per-user configuration file, etc.

Web content generation is mostly based on HTML, but HTML doesn't separate the information from its presentation, mixing formatting tags, descriptive tags and programmable logic (both on server side and client side). Cocoons changes this view allowing content to be written in XML, style on XSL stylesheets (or, given the latest XSL specification which is not currently implemented, on XSLT transformation sheets) and logic another XSL stylesheet that converts the whole thing to the XSP namespace. This allows the complete separation (placing them on different files) of the three layers used to create content. The Cocoon framework creates web content by processing these layers with the ability to create, for example, valid HTML as output.

dhttp://www.debian.org/ Debian is a free, or Open Source, operating system (OS) for your computer. An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer, does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs. Debian uses the Linux kernel, a free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by (probably over 1000) programmers worldwide. A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from GNU, which are also free. Of course, the thing that people want is software; tools to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 1500 packages (precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine).

DTK's deception is programmable, but it is typically limited to producing output in response to attacker input in such a way as to simulate the behavior of a system which is vulnerable to the attackers method.

The high level functions perform queries for records of a given name, type, and class, and return an array of records. A cache is used to reduce the number of queries sent. The low level functions allow direct manipulation of dns messages and records, as well as allowing additional resolver properties to be set. A 'dig' clone, dynamic update program, and basic server are also included. Extensions to the DNS protocol are supported as well (DNSSEC, TSIG, EDNS0).

dhttp://www.cardiothink.com/downloads/ecg2png/ ecg2png converts scanned 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. The problems this program solves are that an ECG scanned at relatively high resolution puts a large memory load on the Web browser because it contains about 6 million color pixels. Also, typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into many colors, not just red, black, and white. The resulting file cannot be compressed efficiently and takes more time to transmit over low-speed network connections. This program shrinks the image while preserving the signal and cleans up the color map, yielding a bitmap that is well-suited for Web-based distribution of ECG images.

If you want to know if the load on your system suddenly goes up you can do that too. ESM will get the results of all of these monitors, make a system report and then send that report with a sender.

The scheduling is done in a cooperative way, i.e. the threads are dispatched based on priority and pending events. The event facility allows threads to wait until various types of events occur, including pending I/O on filedescriptors, elapsed timers, pending I/O on message ports, thread and process termination, and even customized callback functions.

A signed assertion that can be sent over an untrusted network is called a Credential Assertion. Credential assertions, which serve the role of "certificates," have the same syntax as policy assertions with the additional feature that they are signed by the entity delegating the trust. A KeyNote evaluator accepts as input a set of local policy assertions, a collection of credential assertions, and a collection of attributes, called an "action environment," that describes a proposed trusted action associated with a set of public keys. KeyNote determines whether proposed actions are consistent with local policy by applying the assertion predicates to the action environment.

And pressing CTRL+U in a text editor will fill in 'unsigned' as if you have typed it.

The two most practical uses of L2TP are establishment of virtual private networks and the ability to separate the devices which physically accept calls (say a modem or an ISDN termination) from the device which terminates the PPP call (say a centralized server). L2TP consists of two pieces: the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) and the L2TP Network Server (LNS). The LAC is the device which physically terminates a call. The LNS is the part which terminates and probably authenticates the PPP stream.

dhttp://theory.org/software/ant/ Langton's Ant is an example of a finite-state cellular automata. The ant (or ants) start out on a grid. Each cell is either black or white. If the ant is on a black square, it turns right 90° and moves forward one unit. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left 90° and moves forward one unit. And when the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color. The neat thing about Langton's Ant is that no matter what pattern field you start it out on, it eventually builds a "road," which is a series of 117 steps that repeat indefinitely, each time leaving the ant displaced one pixel vertically and horizontally.

But lemon is not compatible with either yacc or bison. There are several important differences: Lemon uses a different grammar syntax which is less prone to programming errors. Lemon generates a parser that is faster than Yacc or Bison parsers. The parser generated by Lemon is both re-entrant and thread-safe. Lemon includes the concept of a non-terminal destructor, which makes it much easier to write a parser that does not leak memory.

dhttp://www.sylvantech.com/~talin/projects/libasset.html libasset is a C library for game developers, designed to simplify the process of managing and distributing game assets such as sprites, textures, sounds, MIDI files, etc. Rather than using a proprietary resource file format as is done in many commercial games, it assumes that the assets are stored in an ordinary zip file. The library allows fast, random-access retrieval of assets. It also supports the idea of an "asset path", which consists of either zipfiles or real directories, similar to the Java "classpath" concept. In this way, the artists working on the game need only to place their working directories on the path before the main resource file, which will cause any assets that they produce to override similarly-named assets in the main resource file.

An administrator is automatically contacted and he or she assigns the ticket to a specialized worker who is automatically notified of the assignment. It allows automated processes (such as mon) to enter advisory tickets for events so production outages can be tracked. All of MeterMaid's functionality is contained in two Perl modules which implement a clean and simple API, making it very easy to write clients to enter and manage tickets in a consistent way. It comes with a complete CGI client interface.

dhttp://mini.net/pub/ts2/minotaur.html Minotaur is a generalized extension which lets you run Python scripts from Tcl, or Tcl from Perl, or any of the other combinations. Minotaur works by loading the appropriate shared library into another script language's context. So, for example, running Tcl from Python means that the Python main program imports the Minotaur extension, which in turn loads the Tcl libraries - thus Tcl becomes "embedded" into the Python runtime environment (which is similar to embedding Tcl in a normal C program). As involved as that sounds, performance is already surprisingly good, and the capability is turning out to be quite useful. Minotaur 0.1 is an alpha level release, meaning: it works, aside from a few quirks and bugs, but its API and implementation might still change in incompatible ways in future releases.

The core of MOSIX is adaptive (on-line) load-balancing and memory ushering algorithms that respond to variations in the use of the cluster resources, in order to maximize the overall performance. These algorithms use preemptive process migration to assign and reassign the processes among the nodes to take advantage of the best available resources, just like in an SMP. The MOSIX algorithms are geared for maximal performance, overhead-free scalability and ease-of-use.

All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code through the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time. All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is sent to a separate log file in order to keep its diagnostics separate from any that the program being tested might generate. A wide variety of library settings can also be changed at run-time via an environment variable, thus removing the need to recompile or relink in order to change the library's behaviour.

dhttp://www-serra.unipi.it/~ntop/ ntop is a tool that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular Unix command top does. ntop can be used in both interactive or web mode. In the first case, ntop displays the network status on the user's terminal whereas in web mode a web browser (e.g. netscape) can attach to ntop (that acts as a web server) and get a dump of the network status. In the latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an embedded web interface.

These files allow aliases that aren´t used very often to not even be loaded until the time that they are needed. After they are used they are unloaded. This makes the memory usage a lot lower and creates a huge speed increase. The release of 0123 was mainly to fix a bug found in 0105 where users were able to exploit /encode to make anyone running pv-0105 controllable remotely. A few other things were added such as a feature to set default channel modes and 2 more ansis.

The main additional feature is the possibility to undock or dock the MDI child frame windows using the taskbar so you can provide both styles, Windows-style docked windows and UNIX-style undocked toplevel widgets.

This typically happens due to connection errors, negotiation errors upon re-dialing, or when the ISP wants to be a bandwidth controller or decides on a hang-up timeout for you. Running this daemon will insure that the default route to a PPP interface will stay active.

(2) promote perl as the interface/scripting/glue language of choice for interaction with SAP R/3.

The trick is that it merges the skeleton and the templates in a priority-driven way. The idea is taken from X Consortiums Imake, but the goal here is not inherited system independency, the goal is consistency and power without the need of manually maintaining a Makefile hierarchy. SMake is intentionally not a feature-rich Makefile generator like Automake.

UESQLC is based on Structured Query Language (SQL) as a standard for accessing data. This interface provides maximum interoperability, i.e. a single application can access different SQL Database Management Systems (DBMS) through a common set of embedded SQL code (UESQL). This enables a developer to build and distribute a client/server application without targeting a specific DBMS.

dhttp://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/userv/ userv is a Unix system facility to allow one program to invoke another when only limited trust exists between them. It is a tool for system administrators, who often find themselves with a program running as one user which needs to be able to do certain things as another user. For example, the author's machine's news system needs to scan its users' newsrcs to ensure that the right newsgroups are fetched. Before userv that part of the news system had to run as root, and clumsily use `su'.

Instead it uses a plaintext db which is stored in each "watched" directory. By using this there is no real one attack point for an attacker to focus his attention on. This coupled with the running of ViperDB every 5 minutes (via cron root job) decreases that likelihood that an attacker will be able to modify your "watched" filesystem while ViperDB is monitoring your system.

dhttp://www.it.uc3m.es/%7eptb/cgi-bin/cvs-yoke.cgi The Yoke driver provides transparant mirroring between disk partitions and other block devices (such as loop and nbd). It differs from the kernel RAID0 facility in that it is a virtual device with no interface of its own. To start mirroring one device to another requires no prior setup, just "yadd /dev/yd0 yet_another_device" and go. The yet_another_device will become another facet of the existing mirror and you can still read and write to it perfectly normally, with the difference that all changes will be seen and reflected in/from all the other mirror facets.

dEl Gonismo es una doctrina exclusiva para miembros nacidos con el don del tardismo.Solo unos pocos elegidos logran ejercerla.Su exclusividad se debe a que no cualquiera puede aprenderla.Se necesita una completa falta de sentido comun y logica humana heredada basica. Pocas personas logran alcanzar el nivel de tardismo necesario para ejercerla.Famosos practicantes incluyen a Gon, roxyta, y Vagonetas
